## Backlog
Nothing to work on.

## Study command-line interface
- `KeyboardReader.java` Fig 4.7 p 157
- `GreeterApp.java` Fig 4.9 p. 159

## Create a Command-Line Interface to calculate square-root
Turn `GreeterApp.java` into a program that asks user for a number and prints the square-root of the number. 

To calculate the square-root, use the `NewtonSquareRoot` class.

## Study graphical user interface
- `GreeterGUI.java` Fig 4.20 p. 174

## Create a Graphical User Interface to calculate square-root
Turn `GreeterGUI.java` into a program that asks user for a number and displays the square-root of the number. Save code in `SquareRootGUI.java`.

To calculate the square-root, use the `NewtonSquareRoot` class.

Compare the UML and code of the GUI and Command-Line programs.
