# Lecture l06

## Reading
Pre-read:
- Section 6.3 Counting loops
- Section 6.6 Conditional loops

Reading during break:
- Section 6.7 Example: Computing Averages
- Section 6.8 Example: Data Validation


Additional reading:  



## Backlog
No backlog.

## Loop introduction
Add in `Loops.java`:

- for loop: Gradient Descent
- while loop: Self-study exercise 6.9 p. 262 
- do while loop: Loosing grass on p.263


## Review loops

Solve Exercise 6.9 p. 292 using:
- nested for loops
- nested while loops
- nested do-while loops

Use `SkiJump.java`.

## break and continue
A quick intro to `break` and `continue` keywords: https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_break.asp

Are  `break` and `continue` good programming habits? Discussion https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/58237/are-break-and-continue-bad-programming-practices

## Calculate averages
- Study calculate averages example Fig 6.10 p. 269.
- How could pseudo-code on p. 266 be written differently?
- Incorporate data validation. Could test be wrapped in a method?

Use `GradeAverage.java`.

## Exercises
- Self study Ex. 6.9: Number theory problem that terminates at 0.
- Self study Ex 6.13: Pizza price entry method using codes 1, 2, 3 and 0 to terminate.
- Exercise 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.18, 6.20
