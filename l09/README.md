## Backlog
No backlog.

## Array introduction
Concepts:
- Create 1D and 2D arrays
- Access and update elements
- Pure vs. modifier methods

TODOs in `ArrayTest.java`:
- Implement a `printArray()` method
- Implement a `resizeArray()` method (pure method)
- Implement a `fillArray()` method (modifier method)

Side note: Many of the functionalities implemented here are available in `java.utils.Arrays`.

## String split() instead of StringTokenizer
See lecture notes.

Re-visit `TextAnalysis.java` from l07.

Hint: Might need trimming and filtering out empty strings.


## Character Frequency

- Implement `LetterFreq.java` From UML Fig 9.9 p.404
- Implement `AnalyzeFreq.java` From UML Fig 9.11 p.405
- (optional) add a `printHist()` method that would print `*` in per letter.

Talk about [java enhanced for loop](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/for.html)

## Vector (and ArrayList, LinkedList)
See lecture notes.

This might be covered in l10 if time is tight.
